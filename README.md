# instaTrackr
Made a small python script to read my followers and people I'm following.
To not go against Instagram guidelines, I made this to where you should:
1. Go to Instagram Accounts Center
2. Go to your information and permissions
3. Click on download your information
4. There, you're given the option to download specific data- in this case you click the following and followers folder
5. Extract the zip file and plug into your repo
6. Copy this code and run!
